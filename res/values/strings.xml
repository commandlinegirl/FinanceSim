    <string name="about_text1"><b>FinanceSim</b> simulates your future financial situation based on all the earnings (capital 
        and non-capital income) and spendings (debts and expenses) you incur each month. It generates simulations showing the rate of growth of your 
        assets and liabilities.
        It will tell you: \n
         - when you are going to get your (first) million \n
         - how fast will your 401(k) grow \n
         - what is the comparative return of all your assets (investments)\n
         - and more.</string>
    <string name="about_title2"><b>Assumptions</b></string>
    <string name="about_text2">Constant inflation, constant return from 401(k) and other investments or savings account, and constant tax rate.</string>
    <string name="about_title3"><b>What this app is not</b></string>
    <string name="about_text3"><b>FinanceSim</b>  is not an expense, income or debt tracker. It uses the data you may track elsewhere, though, as input for the simulations.</string>
